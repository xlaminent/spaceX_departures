                            <h3>Falcon 9</h3>
                            <p> Falcon 9 is a EELV-class medium-lift partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle, 
                                powered by nine Merlin engines and burns cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>It evolved from versions v1.0 (2010–2013), v1.1 (2013–2016) to v1.2 Full Thrust (2015–present). Since the introduction of the Full Thrust version it became partially reusable - the first stage is 
                                capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after separation. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                Five rockets of the version 1.0 were launched from 2010-2013, 15 of verison 1.1 from 2013-2016. 
                                Fromhereon version "<span class="accentuate detail">Full Thrust</span>" took over and has since seen additional upgrades within the version, and is to this day  
                                the current ongoing version of Falcon.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                Block 5 was introduced in may of 2018 and it features increased engine thrust, improved landing legs and 
                                other improvements on recovery and reuse.

                            <p>
                                Falcon 1 was the first launch system developed and manufactured by SpaceX in the period between 
                                2006-2009 when it retired and was succeeded by Falcon 9.
                                <br/>
                                It was a two-stage-to-orbit rocket that used LOX/RP-1 for both stages, the first powered by a 
                                single Merlin engine, the second were powered by a single Kestrel engine.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                September 2008 the Falcon 1 made headlines by becoming the first privately-developed liquid-fuel launch 
                                vehicle to go into orbit around earth. 
                                <br/>

                                It would total up to five launches, the last flight took place july 2009 - it also marked the 
                                first commercial launch for SpaceX.

                                The Falcon Heavy was introduced in early 2018, it consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as its 
                                center core and attached to two standard Falcon 9 first stages that are used as boosters. It has the highest payload capacity 
                                of any currently operational launch vehicle.

                                Falcon Heavy has been certified for the american National Security Space Launch program.
